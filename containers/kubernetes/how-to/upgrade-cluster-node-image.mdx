Kubernetes Kapsule clusters regularly receive updated [node images](/containers/kubernetes/reference-content/kubernetes-node-images/), and it is recommended to regularly upgrade these images to leverage the latest features.

This guide provides instructions on how to upgrade node images in your Kubernetes Kapsule cluster and how to update node pool images without changing the Kubernetes version.
