Kubernetes node images refer to the containerized operating system and runtime environment that run on each node within a Kubernetes cluster.
These images encapsulate the essential components necessary for hosting and managing containers, such as the container runtime (e.g. `containerd`), the kubelet (Kubernetes agent), and other dependencies.

In Kubernetes, a node is a physical or virtual machine inside a cluster, that serves for deploying and running containerized workloads.
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a main node (control plane) and multiple worker nodes. These worker nodes are where the actual containers run.
